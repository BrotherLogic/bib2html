A very simple script to convert between .bib files and .html

It is unlikely to work on your bib file unless each bib key and value are on the same line - use it at your own risk!

It runs like this:

python allpubs.py "Tucker, S." /Users/sat/workspace/bib/read.bib

Where the first param is your name as it appears in the bib file and the second is the path to the bib file. I make no promises that it will work on your bib file!
